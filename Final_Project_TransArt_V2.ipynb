        "### How to use this app:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Tamil Text**:\n",
        "   - You can either select one of the suggested Tamil phrases or input your own text. The app primarily focuses on Tamil inputs, but it supports a wide range of other languages as well (see the list below).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Generate Translations**:\n",
        "   - Once you've input your text, the app will automatically translate it to English. The translation model is a **many-to-one model**, meaning it can take input from various languages and translate it into English.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generate Educational Content**:\n",
        "   - After translating the text into English, the app will generate **educational content** based on the translated input. You can adjust the creativity of the content generation using the temperature slider, and control the length of the output with the token limit setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Generate Images**:\n",
        "   - In addition to generating content, the app can also generate an **image** related to the translated content. You don’t need to worry about creating complex image prompts—FusionMind includes an automatic **image prompt generator** that will convert your input into a well-defined image prompt, ensuring better image generation results.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multilingual Translation**:\n",
        "   - FusionMind supports a **many-to-one translation model**, so you can input text in a wide variety of languages, not just Tamil. Below are the supported languages:\n",
        "\n",
        "     - **Arabic (ar_AR)**, **Czech (cs_CZ)**, **German (de_DE)**, **English (en_XX)**, **Spanish (es_XX)**, **Estonian (et_EE)**, **Finnish (fi_FI)**, **French (fr_XX)**, **Gujarati (gu_IN)**, **Hindi (hi_IN)**, **Italian (it_IT)**, **Japanese (ja_XX)**, **Kazakh (kk_KZ)**, **Korean (ko_KR)**, **Lithuanian (lt_LT)**, **Latvian (lv_LV)**, **Burmese (my_MM)**, **Nepali (ne_NP)**, **Dutch (nl_XX)**, **Romanian (ro_RO)**, **Russian (ru_RU)**, **Sinhala (si_LK)**, **Turkish (tr_TR)**, **Vietnamese (vi_VN)**, **Chinese (zh_CN)**, **Afrikaans (af_ZA)**, **Azerbaijani (az_AZ)**, **Bengali (bn_IN)**, **Persian (fa_IR)**, **Hebrew (he_IL)**, **Croatian (hr_HR)**, **Indonesian (id_ID)**, **Georgian (ka_GE)**, **Khmer (km_KH)**, **Macedonian (mk_MK)**, **Malayalam (ml_IN)**, **Mongolian (mn_MN)**, **Marathi (mr_IN)**, **Polish (pl_PL)**, **Pashto (ps_AF)**, **Portuguese (pt_XX)**, **Swedish (sv_SE)**, **Swahili (sw_KE)**, **Tamil (ta_IN)**, **Telugu (te_IN)**, **Thai (th_TH)**, **Tagalog (tl_XX)**, **Ukrainian (uk_UA)**, **Urdu (ur_PK)**, **Xhosa (xh_ZA)**, **Galician (gl_ES)**, **Slovene (sl_SI)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Temperature Adjustment**:\n",
        "   - You can adjust the **temperature** of the content generation. A **higher temperature** makes the content more creative and varied, while a **lower temperature** generates more focused and deterministic responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Token Limit**:\n",
        "   - Set the **maximum number of tokens** for content generation. This allows you to control the length of the generated educational content.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Automatic Retries**:\n",
        "   - If a translation request fails due to any reason, the app is designed to **automatically retry**, ensuring a smooth experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Auto-Generated Image Prompts**:\n",
        "   - One of the unique features of FusionMind is the **auto-generated image prompts**. Even if you're not experienced in creating detailed prompts for image generation, the app will take care of this for you. It automatically converts the translated text or content into a well-defined prompt that produces more accurate and high-quality images.\n",
